## BautyFragrant eCommerce App

The project was published at https://diazlp.github.io/bautyfragrant/

I think the application would speak for itself. It's still as horrendous as it is (I'm still proud of it, though). 

The technology I used was simply HTML5, CSS, and aloot of jQuery, also some other libraries that relies heavily on jQuery code.

Anyway, check it out but don't tell me what you think :D

PS: Please try not to read the code, I just stuffed all the logic in one file and call it a day. I warned you.
