## BautyFragrant eCommerce App

The project was published at https://diazlp.github.io/bautyfragrant/

I think the app would speak for itself. It's still as horrendous as it is. 

The technology I used was simply HTML5, CSS, and aloot of jQuery, also some other libraries that relies heavily on jQuery.

Check it out but don't tell me what you think :D
